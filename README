a rather underwhelming port of ovm.c to win32.
where port == mark almost everything posix not_implemented

  $ make all
  $ wine test.exe
  vm-error: setup: not implemented: tcgetattr (no termios)
  Hello, World!
  vm-error: setdown: not implemented: setdown (no termios)

download pre-compiled:
* https://pub.krzysckh.org/ovm.exe
* https://pub.krzysckh.org/ol.exe
* https://pub.krzysckh.org/ol-angry.exe (ol.exe with not_implemented messages)

CAVEATS

* you need a working owl on unix setup to compile this
* most OS stuff is not implemented.
* ol.exe doesn't contain win32 runtime. if you want to compile to C,
  you need to use `ol.exe -C ovm.c` to use this ovm.c as runtime.
