a rather underwhelming port of ovm.c to win32.
----------------------------------------------

BUILDING

  $ $EDITOR Makefile # use common sense
  $ make all

or download pre-compiled:
* https://pub.krzysckh.org/ovm.exe
* https://pub.krzysckh.org/ol.exe
* https://pub.krzysckh.org/ol-angry.exe (ol.exe with not_implemented messages)

CAVEATS

* you need a working owl on unix setup to compile this
* ol.exe doesn't contain win32 runtime. if you want to compile to C,
  you need to use `ol.exe -C ovm.c` to use this ovm.c as runtime.
* main TODOS:
  * crucial:
    [ ] - threading
    [x] - networking
    [ ] - wait
    [ ] - kill
    [ ] - stat for directories
    [ ] - fcntl
  * non-crucial:
    [ ] - fork
    [ ] - raw terminal operatins
    [ ] - {,sym,read}link
    [ ] - chmod
    [ ] - chown
  * qol:
    [ ] - embed ovm.c inside ol.exe
